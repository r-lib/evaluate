\title{An emulation of \code{flush.console()} in \code{evaluate()}}
\usage{
flush_console()
}
\description{
When \code{\link[=evaluate]{evaluate()}} is evaluating code, the text output is diverted into
an internal connection, and there is no way to flush that connection. This
function provides a way to "flush" the connection so that any text output can
be immediately written out, and more importantly, the \code{text} handler
(specified in the \code{output_handler} argument of \code{evaluate()}) will
be called, which makes it possible for users to know it when the code
produces text output using the handler.

This function is supposed to be called inside \code{evaluate()} (e.g.
either a direct \code{evaluate()} call or in \pkg{knitr} code chunks).
