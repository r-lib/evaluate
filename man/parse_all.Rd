\title{Parse, retaining comments}
\usage{
parse_all(x, filename = NULL, allow_error = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{object to parse.  Can be a string, a file connection, or a function.
If a connection, will be opened and closed only if it was closed initially.}

\item{filename}{string overriding the file name}

\item{allow_error}{whether to allow syntax errors in \code{x}}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns \code{src}, the source code, and
\code{expr}. If there are syntax errors in \code{x} and \code{allow_error = TRUE}, the data frame has an attribute \code{PARSE_ERROR} that stores the
error object.
}
\description{
Works very similarly to parse, but also keeps original formatting and
comments.
