\usage{
evaluate(
  input,
  envir = parent.frame(),
  enclos = NULL,
  debug = FALSE,
  stop_on_error = 0L,
  keep_warning = TRUE,
  keep_message = TRUE,

}
\arguments{
\item{input}{input object to be parsed and evaluated.  May be a string, file
connection or function.  Passed on to \code{\link[=parse_all]{parse_all()}}.}

\item{envir}{environment in which to evaluate expressions.}

\item{enclos}{when \code{envir} is a list or data frame, this is treated as
the parent environment to \code{envir}.}

\item{debug}{if \code{TRUE}, displays information useful for debugging,
including all output that evaluate captures.}

\item{stop_on_error}{if \code{2}, evaluation will halt on first error and you
will get no results back. If \code{1}, evaluation will stop on first error
without signaling the error, and you will get back all results up to that
point. If \code{0} will continue running all code, just as if you'd pasted
the code into the command line.}

\item{keep_warning, keep_message}{whether to record warnings and messages; if
\code{FALSE}, messages will be suppressed; if \code{NA}, they will not be captured
(normally they will be sent to the console). Note that if the environment
variable \code{R_EVALUATE_BYPASS_MESSAGES} is set to true, these arguments will
always be set to \code{NA}, meaning that messages will not be captured by this
function.}

\item{log_echo, log_warning}{If \code{TRUE}, will immediately log code and
warnings (respectively) to \code{stderr}.}

\item{new_device}{if \code{TRUE}, will open a new graphics device and
automatically close it after completion. This prevents evaluation from
interfering with your existing graphics environment.}

\item{output_handler}{an instance of \code{\link[=output_handler]{output_handler()}} that
processes the output from the evaluation. The default simply prints the
visible return values.}

\item{filename}{string overrriding the \code{\link[base:srcfile]{base::srcfile()}} filename.}

\item{include_timing}{if \code{TRUE}, evaluate will wrap each input
expression in \code{system.time()}, which will be accessed by following
\code{replay()} call to produce timing information for each evaluated
command.}
}
\description{
Compare to \code{\link[=eval]{eval()}}, \code{evaluate} captures all of the
information necessary to recreate the output as if you had copied and pasted
the code into a R terminal. It captures messages, warnings, errors and
output, all correctly interleaved in the order in which they occured. It
stores the final result, whether or not it should be visible, and the
contents of the current graphics device.
